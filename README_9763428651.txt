This lab is an image processing lab, where the program takes all the RGB photos in a certain path. It then prompts the user of the program to perform a certain operation, does that operation on every file in that path, and then outputs the new photos in another folder.

There are 6 operations this lab does:
 
 1: Flip 90 Degrees Clockwise
 2: Flip Image 180 Degrees
 3: Mirror Image
 4: Grey Scale Image
 5: Color Inversion
 6: Zoom In

 It will loads all the images with a .bmp extension in the original-photos folder, prompt the user for which operation, and then save all the modified versions of those photos in the modified-photos folder.


Typing in the numbers in front of each operation is what prompts that operation. Otherwise, if the command is not recognized, the program exits.

menu.cpp, bmplib.cpp, and imagefunctions.cpp need to be compiled for this program to run.
